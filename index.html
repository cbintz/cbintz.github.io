            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hi there! I grew up in Washington State before traveling accross the country to Vermont to study  at Middlebury College. I took a gap semester
            before starting college to travel and volunteer. I started school
            in February 2017 and will graduate in February of 2021.
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Global Health. My global health coursework at Middlebury has included the courses: Global Health, Social Entrepreneurship and Global Health, Health Policy and Economics, Medical Anthropology, and Unplanned Parenthood. I have also taken a variety of Economics courses. I am particularly interested in applications of data science for
            social good. My coursework as a computer science major has included instruction in both computational theory and development of technical
            skills.  Particularly relevant coursework includes <b> <i> Machine Learning, Information Visualization, Algorithms and Complexity, Economic Statistics, and Introduction to Data Science</b></i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also spent a semester from January to May of 2019 studying abroad in Stockholm, Sweden with <a href='https://disabroad.org/stockholm/'>DIS.</a> Here, I took courses in Public Health, including <b> <i> Public Health and Migration, Public Health
            Policy in Practice, and Epidemiology </b> </i>, as well as working as research assistant for a project titled HIV and Reproductive Technology Access.

            <h3>Harvard Medical School Summer Institue in Biomedical Informatics </h3>
            <h3>June 2020-Present • Cambridge, Massachusetts</h3>
            <b><h4>Research Fellow</h4></b> Most recently, I participated as a Research Fellow in the Summer Institue of Biomedical Informatics through the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. I worked with Dr. Maha Farhat,
            who heavily researches multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. I developed data visualizations and machine learning pipelines for tuberculosis genomic data on the Farhat Lab’s  <a href='https://gentb.hms.harvard.edu/'>web tool</a>.
            I developed the visualizations using D3.js and Django. I also analyzed relationships between country-level social determinants of health such as population density, wealth per capita, and household size and rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. I am continuing my research with Dr. Farhat, investigating the relationship between health spending and rates of
            multidrug-resistant tuberculosis over time using linear mixed models.

            <b><h4> Community Development Intern</h4></b> In January 2020, I interned with the Andean Alliance for Sustainable Development located in the Sacred Valley of Perú. The Andean Alliance for Sustainable Development is a non-profit supporting sustainable agricultural initiatives in campesino (farming) communities in the Sacred Valley of Perú. The project I contribted to in January Investigated perceptions and realities of indigenous women’s contribution to community development in the Sacred Valley. We designed and conducted a series of informal, semi-structured interviews in various high-altitude communities. We conducted in Spanish and often included a translator for Spanish to Quechua transaltion.

            <b><h4>Data Science Student Fellow</h4></b> In summer 2019 , I worked as a student fellow with the University of Washington eScience Institute's Data Science
            for Social Good Program. In partnership with the ACLU of Washington, we created an Algorithmic Equity Toolkit designed to empower community members the information regarding surveillane tehcnologies, automated decision systems,
             and algorithmic bias for for more effective activism. Specifically, I contributed to an interactive demo using showcasing the harms with facial recognition software. Through building the demo, I worked heavily with Dash, Docker,
             and OpenFace, an open source facial recognition tool. I also helped create our technology red flag questionairre and technology identification guide. This project gave me experience with stakeholder engagment, prototype creation,
             human-centered design, and user-persona formation. Here are some featured blog posts about the program and the project I worked on: <br><br>
