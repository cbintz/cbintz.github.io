            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hi there! I grew up in Washington State before traveling accross the country to Vermont to study  at Middlebury College. I took a gap semester
            before starting college to travel and volunteer, so I am currently mid-way through my junior year at Middlebury College. I started school
            in February 2017 and will graduate in February of 2021.

            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Global Health. I have also taken a variety of Economics courses. I am particularly interested in applications of data science for
            social good. My coursework as a computer science major has included instruction in both computational theory and development of technical
            skills.  Particularly relevant coursework includes <b> <i> Machine Learning, Information Visualization, Algorithms and Complexity, Economic Statistics, and Introduction to Data Science</b></i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also spent a semester from January to May of 2019 studying abroad in Stockholm, Sweden with <a href='https://disabroad.org/stockholm/'>DIS.</a> Here, I took courses in Public Health, including <b> <i> Public Health and Migration, Public Health
            Policy in Practice, and Epidemiology </b> </i>, as well as working as research assistant for a project titled HIV and Reproductive Technology Access.

            <h3>University of Washington eScience Institute Data Science for Social Good</h3>
            <h3>June 2019-Present • Seattle, Washington</h3>
            <b><h4>Data Science Student Fellow</h4></b> Most recently, I worked as a student fellow with the University of Washington eScience Institute's Data Science
            for Social Good Program. In partnership with the ACLU of Washington, we created an Algorithmic Equity Toolkit designed to empower community members the information regarding surveillane tehcnologies, automated decision systems,
             and algorithmic bias for for more effective activism. Specifically, I contributed to an interactive demo using showcasing the harms with facial recognition software. Through building the demo, I worked heavily with Dash, Docker,
             and OpenFace, an open source facial recognition tool. I also helped create our technology red flag questionairre and technology identification guide. This project gave me experience with stakeholder engagment, prototype creation,
             human-centered design, and user-persona formation. Here are some featured blog posts about the program and the project I worked on: <br><br>

            <b><h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4></b> From May to August 2018, I worked as a Software Engineer intern at myStrength at Livongo, a digital behavioral health
            company located in Denver, Colorado. For the first 5 weeks of my internship, I contributed to native cross-platform mobile development in C# using the Xamarin framework. I spent the second 5 weeks
            developed features for the mobile application in a Java-based RESTful API. In this role, I Utilized MySQL to write queries and Liquibase for data migrations. Throughout the whole summer, I participated in in the Agile Development Process, working with the engineering team on two-week sprints, testing, and deployments.
            Here's a link to my end-of-summer presentation: <a href='https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/3gsOFDcsXuxB1K'>Final Presentation</a>

            <b><h4>Staff Facilitator</h4></b> Girls Inc.'s Eureka! program is a five-year program that begins the summer after seventh grade and continues until the summer before senior year. The Eureka! program follows Girls Inc.'s mission to inspire all girls to be strong, smart, and bold, specifically in the STEM field. As a staff facilitator, I worked with my co-facilitator to prepare and facilitate personal development, STEM, and physical activity curricula to a group of five youth entering freshman year. Along with facilitating curriculum, I took the youth on a field trip once a week to local STEM workplaces. This involved driving a fifteen-passenger van from our location at Mt. Hood Community College to various workplaces in Portland, Oregon.

            <h3>Technical Projects</h3>
            I have worked on a variety of machine learning and information visualization technical projects. Some of my favorite projects
            have focused on social issues I feel passionate about, such as racial disparities in maternal mortality in the United States
            and health resource gaps in Vermont. I also worked on an interesting machine learning project trying to identify genes that
            predict survival for lung cancer. Visit the links below to learn more: <br>
